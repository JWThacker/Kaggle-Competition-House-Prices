    "# Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook \"eda.ipynb\" I cleaned up the dataset, performed EDA, and feature engineering. I also explained my thought process for just about every step in that EDA/preprocessing notebook. In summary, there were several features that were sparse (the majority of the values were missing) - these were removed. There were other columns that had missing values - *however they were not missing at random*. The values that were missing were associated with houses that *did not* have a garage or a basement or neither of the two. I dealt with these missing values appropriately. In addition, I performed feature engineering - factors were selected graphically and then engineered mostly by aggregating low-sample levels/classes with similar levels/classes that had more samples; *this was done so the learning process of the models I choose are not dominated by one class*. Numerical features were selected by analysing the Spearman's correlation coefficient - those numerical features with large (enough) correlations were selecte. Spearman's correlation was used so as to not rule out nonlinear montonic relationships. Lastly, I calculated the *principal components* and determined that *eight* components were appropriate by analyzing the explained variance as a function of the number of principal components - *eight* principal components were most appropriate for the subset of features I chose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I perform model selection and validation. The models I chose for this competition are:\n",
    "  1. **(OLS) Linear Regression**: because this model can be used as a benchmark model.\n",
    "  2. **Ridge Regression**: since this is a regularized version of linear regression, this will balance the bias/variance and generally lead to a more accurate model. As a result, LASSO and Ridge tend to result in parsimonious models.\n",
    "  3. **KNN**: There's actually no real reason why I chose to give this model a shot other than the fact I've relative success with it in the past.\n",
    "  4. **XGBoost**: I've always had great success with a random forest, so I knew I wanted to give an ensemble method a shot. I also know from other Kagglers that XGBoost is kind of a gold standard and still often outperforms more sophisticated methods such as neural networks.\n",
    "  5. **Stacked Generalization** - I had no idea how this model worked, but I knew it was popular among the competition crowd at least at one point. This gave me an excuse to develop a high-level understanding of how this model worked and to try it out. As can be seen from the results at the end of this notebook - this model dominated the other four individually.\n",

This is, of course, okay. *Both* cross_val_score and GridSearchCV make use of k-fold cross-validation which will provide me estimates of the *negative mean squared error* on the *validation* sets within each iteration.

From the pointplot below, we can see that the stacked regressor outperforms all of the other models by almost 2-fold (and the stacked regressor outperforms **KNN** by more than this). **XGBoost**, **linear regression**, and **ridge regression** perform similarly and the model with the worst performance is **KNN**.\n",

    "In this notebook I accomplished a lot - model selection and validation. I evaluated each base model, namely **KNN**, **linear regression**, **ridge regression**, and **XGBoost** separately using 5-fold CV. I then decided to see how a **stacked regression** would perform by combining a reltively inflexible model (**ridge regression**) and a highly flexible model (**XGBoost**) as my stacked learners and I then used OLS as my meta-learner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The stacked regression clearly had the highest performance of all the models and I therefore used this model for my submission to the competition. I fully expected to come in about dead-last in the competition, but I did a lot better than I thought - I came in **2491/4325** place at the time of my submission. This was really fun and I see myself being a regular in these competitions to simply just to push myself to learn more about predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to discuss the best fit hyperparameters of the base-learners that were used in the **stacked regression**. The best $\\alpha$ value for the **ridge regression** was $\\alpha=1$. This particular parameter would have made the second-most inflexible regression model (remember, larger values of $\\alpha$ mean a more biased/inflexible regression model. In addition, the best performing **XGBoost** hyperparmeters were 5 for the maximum depth of a tree and 20 trees - this pair of hyperparameters makes the least complex ensemble of learners. The answer I believe is in the EDA notebook, specifically where I plot the boxplots versus **LogSalePrice** and also where I plot the first *eight* principal components versus **LogSalePrice**. If you first refer to the boxplots of many of the ordered factors you can see that there is what looks like a linearly increasing relationship for higher-order levels. If you now refer to the end of the EDA notebook where I plot the first principal componet versus **LogSalePrice** you can see that there is a strong *linear* relationship. I believe that the relationship between **LogSalePrice** and the features I predicted is close to linear and therefore nonlinear approaches might overfit which is why you see a trend of hyperparameters that will yield less flexlible/linear-like models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, embarassingly, I only decided to look at the plots of the principal components versus **LogSalePrice** **after** I had performed model selection and validation. To my dismay I can really only see a visible relationship between the first principal component and **LogSalePrice** - this is just a consequence of PCA being unsupervised. If I could rewind time I would first see how my model performs on the raw numerical features *and then* see how the princpal components affects model performance - this is the last time I get burned by PCA. I believe that using *only* the raw numerical features in my model will significantly improve its performance. In addition, I would try to improve model performance by performing *more* feature engineering. I believe that calculating more domain specific features would greatly improve the model. Lastly, I also believe that creating meta-features will improve model performance as well. I would calculate things like the mean and standard deviation of each row of the numerical feature model matrix to see how that affects model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found the open-endedness the most difficult and most exciting part of this project. Many academic datasets found at universities and certificate programs have small numbers of predictors/features (< 20). This dataset had a moderate amount (79 to be exact) and it was at first overwhelming, but as you begin to find patterns and uncover relationships it becomes a pleasure to reiterate the different key-points within the CRISP-DM process (EDA for example within the **prepare the data** step or tuning the hyperparameters in the **data modeling** step). I will be continuing this project to climb higher in the rankings after I submit it in its current state for my data scientist capstone. I've already mentioned a couple of ways to improve the performance of my model and I believe I could climb significantly higher in the rankings by implementing these improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice summary of the end-to-end solution can be found in the README.md accompanying the respository that this notebook is located within.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, I am satisfied by my performance in my first machine learning competition and I must say I am hooked. I'm already planning my next beginner competition at Kaggle (the infamous Titanic competition) to learn more and isn't that the whole point?"
